This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to my Pokedex. This project creates a user-friendly interface for navigating data for the original 151 Pokemon.
This projects gets its data from PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/). The user interface is made with React 
(https://react.dev/), MUI (https://mui.com/), and Pokenode-ts, written by [Gabb-c](https://github.com/Gabb-c) 
[Github Repo for Pokenode](https://github.com/Gabb-c/pokenode-ts). npm must be installed to run this application, you
can install it here (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

To run the project naviagte to the `pokedex` folder with the following command (assuming you are in the project root):
`cd pokedex`. You should now be in the pokedex folder. From here run the command `npm install`.
Finally run `npm run start` in the `pokedex` folder, after the installation of node_modules has finished and you should
be redirected to http://localhost:3000. If you are not, simply click the link.
